        <p class="para">Keeping your body upright while making your way down the mountain on a set of skis or a snowboard takes some
            serious concentration, not to mention balancing skills. It also makes the body more flexible, which helps
            prevent muscle strains and sprains.

            “From your core muscles to the small and large muscle groups of the lower legs, the dynamic motion that our
            body is going through while skiing improves balance and stability, both important factors as we move through
            our daily lives,” Cohen explains.

            According to a report in the “Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports,” 12 weeks of skiing
            profoundly impacted the health of 60- to 76-year-olds, leading to a significant increase in their balance,
            along with aerobic capacity, strength, and power.</p>

    <div class="container5">
        <img src="img/img-1 (2).webp" alt="">
        <p class="para">Skiing and snowboarding can be good for weight loss since you’re not only burning calories but building and
            maintaining muscle as well. In addition, the effect of skiing on your body temperature is another benefit,
            as cold outdoor temperatures can potentially cause you to burn more calories. But best of all, it’s a form
            of exercise that’s fun.

            “It’s exercise that doesn’t feel like exercise,” Cohen explains. “When I’m outside enjoying the fresh air on
            the mountain, I’m not thinking, ‘I have to exercise to stay healthy.’ I’m just enjoying myself, which makes
            the workout so much more enjoyable. When you initiate an exercise program because you’re doing something fun
            and exciting, like skiing, the exercise doesn’t feel like a chore.”

            And remember, even when the ski resorts are closed, Mother Nature’s gym is open 24/7, with no annoying
            sign-up charges.</p>

    <div class="container6">
        <img src="img/img-1 (10).webp" alt="">
        <p class="para">According to a study published in Frontiers in Physiology: “Downhill skiing, especially when performed on a
            regular basis, may contribute to healthy aging by its association with a healthier lifestyle, including
            higher levels of physical activity.”

            Skiing is also an activity you can often do into old age. It’s a great adaptable sport in that you can
            control how fast you want to go, how hard you want to work, and how much impact you want.

            Cohen surmises that “Skiing is not just a young person’s sport. The enjoyment it brings is no doubt a reason
            that many people ski late into their lives, having lived a healthy lifestyle for many years.”</p>

    <div class="container7">
        <img src="img/img-1 (8).webp" alt="">
        <p class="para">Like all forms of exercise, skiing and snowboarding help you maintain good overall physical health by
            reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and mental health problems,
            Cohen says.

            "You’re exercising your heart and lungs when you’re skiing in the form of anaerobic and aerobic energy,
            strengthening the cardiopulmonary system, helping to lower unwanted lipids, and stabilizing glucose levels,”
            Cohen explains. “Our bone strength, balance, and stability improve, too, because skiing and snowboarding
            require the use of many muscle groups, leading to the protection of our ligaments and tendons. Even our
            central nervous system is working while we ski as neurons ‘talk’ to our body while we move.”
